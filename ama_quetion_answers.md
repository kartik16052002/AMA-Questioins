## 1. What is a Garbage Collector?

The Garbage Collector in Python automatically frees memory by removing
objects that are no longer referenced.

## 2. Difference between Shallow Copy and Deep Copy

-   **Shallow Copy:** Copies only references of nested objects, not the
    actual objects.
-   **Deep Copy:** Creates a full independent copy of all nested
    objects.

## 3. What are HTML Inline and Block Elements?

-   **Inline elements:** Do not start on a new line and take only

    Examples: `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`

## 7. What is DISTINCT in SQL?

## 8. Why do we use Encapsulation in Python?

To hide internal data, protect variables, and control access using
methods.

## 9. What is a super keyword in Python?

`super()` allows calling parent class methods inside a child class.

## 10. What are Margin, Border, and Padding?

## 11. What are Selectors and why do we use them in CSS?

Selectors target HTML elements to style them. Example: `.class`, `#id`,
`element`.

## 12. What is Polymorphism?

Polymorphism means using the same function name in different ways
(method overloading/overriding).
